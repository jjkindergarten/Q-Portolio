# Q-Portolio
In this repository, there are two R-documents i coded. FactorSelect is a general frame for back test the performance of different factors. ICPlot is a program to plot some features of IC, a important feature of the power of factor.
I cannot pose all of the frame, including other functions used in the FactorSelect on Guthub. Colleagues of the company where i did my internship still use this analysis frame. (they may update it, but the frame is still the basic of everything.)
Just want to show that at least i have some experience in R coding.
